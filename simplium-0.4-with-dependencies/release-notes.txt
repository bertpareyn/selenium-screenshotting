Changes from Simplium 0.3 TO 0.4
=============================================
Updated Simplium to work woth Selenium RC 1.0.1 as there has been some none backward compliant changes to the 
Selenium Server API. Thanks to Dmitry Isachenkov for pointing this out.

Changes that could break older environments:
-------------------------------------------
0.4 only works with Selenium RC 1.0.1 or later.

Fixed bugs:
-----------

Other changes:
--------------
Simplium didn't start a local Selenium RC server if the enviroment was set to TEST or PRODUCTION in previous versions.
This has now been changed so if the TEST or PRODUCTION enviroment is pointing to a RC server on LOCALHOST Simplium will
start a local Selenium RC Server to run it's test against.
@Enviroments(
    test = {
        "localhost",
        "4444",
        "http://localhost:8080"
    },
    production = {
        "localhost",
        "4444",
        "http://localhost:8080"
    }
) 
This setting will cause Simplium to start a local RC server.
